# SPU
Code of Semantic Point Cloud Upsampling (SPU) published on IEEE Transactions on Multimedia.

Our code is based on https://github.com/UncleMEDM/PUGAN-pytorch.
The training and testing files are in the dir. of "train" and "test".

The pre-trained PU model is in the dir. "savedModel".

We will further clean up our code to make it look easily.
